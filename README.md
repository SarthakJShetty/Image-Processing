# Image-Processing
## Incorporating the principles of Image-Processing into differnet applications.

#### This code has been developed after learning concepts from various online resources. Primarily using OpenCV on Python3 to deploy the various projects.

#### Working towards Active Face Recognition, by Live Video analysis.

### Credits
Adrian's [PyImageSearch](imagesearch.com) has been a great starting point for learning a lot of the concepts incorporated in the projects here.

#### Note
- Convolutions and Kerneler code incorporate the use of a Convolution Matrix to perform the various tasks involved in the respective projects.
-The earlier master branch of this repository was wiped due to a forced push. Dev branch includes some of the older code.

### Contents:
1. **Convolutions**: Comprises of Python Code, designed for analysis of fatiguing in materials and different componenets being manufactured. Soon to be spun off into a standalone project. This code has been coupled with TensorFlow, for a fracture detection project. Will be updating the code soon here.

2.**Face Recognition**: Code developed to recognize faces from images. Has to be tuned to read facial features much more accurately. Lots of scope left for development.

3. **Kerneler**: First code added to the repository. Comprises of fundamental concepts seen in other projects within this repository. Continuously use concepts here in other projects.

4. **Video Analysis**: Code to actively track faces in a given video stream. Will be incorporated into other robotics projects. This version of the code works comfortably.

### Filters Used in Convolution and Kerneler Code:
1. Gaussian
2. Laplacian
3. Sobel-X
4. Sobel-Y
5. Sharpen
6. Blue
